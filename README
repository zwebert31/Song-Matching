Software Development (CS 4500)

Team Members:
Kevin Doherty - doherty.kev@husky.neu.edu
Katie Gilligan - gilligan.k@husky.neu.edu

Samuel Lynch - lynch.s@husky.neu.edu

To run the program go to the directory containing dan.py
(Song-Matching folder) and enter the following command:

./dan.py -f <pathname> -f <pathname>

Each of the pathnames will be the paths of songs.
We have placed all of the songs in a folder called
SoundFiles so to get to a file in SoundFiles the
pathname will consist of SoundFiles/<nameofsoundfile>.
