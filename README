To run the program go to the directory Song-Matching which contains the python
file called dan and enter the following command:

./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>

Each of the pathnames will be the paths of audio files.
The file name must end in .wav and be in WAVE format.
The file must have CD-quality parameters as specified below: 
(AudioFormat 1, stereo, 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate).
We have placed all of the audio files in a the same directory as dan.

No third party software was used.
