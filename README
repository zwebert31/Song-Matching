To run the program go to the directory which contains the python
file called dan and enter the following command:

./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>

Each of the pathnames will be the paths of audio files.
The file name must end in .wav and be in WAVE format.
The file must have CD-quality parameters as specified below: 
(AudioFormat 1, stereo, 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate).

No third party software was used.

If the two files match, the text "MATCH <file1> <file2>" will be printed.
If the two files do not match, the text "NO MATCH" will be printed.
If an incorrect command is entered, the text "ERROR: incorrect command line" will be printed.
If an unsupported file type is detected, the text "ERROR: <file> is not a supported format" will be printed.
