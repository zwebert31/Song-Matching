To run the program go to the directory which contains the python
file called dan and enter one of the following commands:

To compare two audio files: 
./dan -f <pathname> -f <pathname>

To compare an audio file to a directory:
./dan -f <pathname> -d <pathname>

To compare a directory to an audio file:
./dan -d <pathname> -f <pathname>

To compare two directories:
./dan -d <pathname> -d <pathname>

Each of the pathnames will either be the path of an audio file or
of a directory. Each individual file must either end in .wav
and be in WAVE format or end in .mp3 and be in MP3 format.
The .wav files must be in RIFF format, AudioFormat 1, stereo
or mono, 8- or 16-bit samples with a sampling rate of 11.025, 22.05,
44.1 or 48 kHz. The .mp3 files must be in MPEG-1 Audio Layer III format.

No third party software was used.

If two files match either from a file path or a directory of files
the text "MATCH <file1> <file2>" will be printed.
If two files do not match, nothing will be printed.
If an incorrect command is entered, the text "ERROR: incorrect command line" 
will be printed.
If an unsupported file type is detected, the text "ERROR: <file> is not a 
supported format" will be printed.

Please note: The comparison of test directory D1 and D2 takes exactly 10
minutes which means it is comparing the files takes about 12 seconds per
file comparison
